It is certainly something I have been thinking about doing for quite some time, but I never really went for it until now. Several reasons have deterred me in the past from creating a personal website, and while some of them might still be valid, I decided to give it a go and create something it could push me to try to create more content and a place where I can experiment with different technology stacks.

## TL;DR

You can take a look at the source code in the website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leosvelperez/leosvel.dev).

## Final thoughts

Building my website was a really fun experience. I enjoyed the process and the fact that I took the chance to experiment with new technologies.

I'm really glad I chose Astro to build the website. Even though it still hasn't reached a stable release, it already works reasonably well and delivers on its promise of achieving great performance. The fact that it's not stable yet and still works this well excites me the more, it's only going to get better!

I achieved the goals I initially had in mind, creating a personal space where I can experiment with new technologies and blog about them and other topics.

It's this the end of the journey? Hell no!

This is just the beginning. I plan to add a couple more pages to the website, continue to improve its design, add more features to the blog, refactor some bits to clean up the code, and from time to time, I might rewrite or build multiple versions of it with different stacks (I'm looking at you [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Qwik](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik)).

Stay tuned! Happy coding!
